## Features

- **Two convolutional blocks** with ReLU activations and max pooling.
- **Dropout regularization** to reduce overfitting.
- **Fully connected layers** mapping features to digit classes (0–9).
- **Built-in training and evaluation methods** inside the CNN class.
- **Automatic loss and accuracy plotting** for training and validation sets.
- **Easy integration** with GPU or CPU.
